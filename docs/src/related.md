### Approximate Bayesian Computation

- [`ABCdeZ.jl`](https://github.com/mauricelanghinrichs/ABCdeZ.jl) -
  Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) with differential evolution
  (de) moves and model evidence (Z) estimates.

- [`ApproxBayes.jl`](https://github.com/marcjwilliams1/ApproxBayes.jl) -
  Implements basic ABC rejection sampler and sequential monte carlo
  algorithm (ABC SMC) as in Toni. et al 2009 as well as model
  selection versions of both (Toni. et al 2010).

- [`GpABC.jl`](https://github.com/tanhevg/GpABC.jl) - ABC with
  emulation on Gaussian Process Regression.

- [`KissABC.jl`](https://github.com/francescoalemanno/KissABC.jl) -
  Implementation of Multiple Affine Invariant Sampling for efficient
  Approximate Bayesian Computation. Is looking for a new maintainer.


### Misc

- [`SimulationBasedInference.jl`](https://github.com/bgroenks96/SimulationBasedInference.jl)
  Despite the name this package seems to focus on traditional Bayesian
  inference methods and not ABC, i.e. it assumes we can evaluate the density of
  the posterior.
